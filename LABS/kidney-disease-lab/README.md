#  Classification Model Evaluation Lab

Focused on applying the lesson on classification metrics. Real world task: <br>
Goal: as a research biostatistical data scientist at the nation's top hospital, I am to develop a medical test that can improve upon our current diagnosis system for [chronic kidney disease (CKD)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521).

Created a Logistic Regression Pipeline (along with corresponding pre-fit transformations) and found optimal parameters using GridSearchCV. Determined the best classification metrics for the problem and optimized for those metrics. Interpreted findings.
