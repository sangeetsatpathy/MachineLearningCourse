# Concrete Strength Lab

## Hypothetical Task
I am working at a civil engineering firm who is interested in which concrete ingredients yield the strongest concrete. My job is to predict the concrete compressive strength given various amounts of different components.

The dataset provided is from the [UCI open dataset list](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength).


## Skills Used:
- Perform basic data cleaning and EDA
- Describe a dataset, including data types, missing values and basic descriptive statistics
- Generate data visualizations
- Fit, generate predictions from, and evaluate a linear regression model
- Interpret the results and coefficients of a linear regression model
