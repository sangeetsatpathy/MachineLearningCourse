### Discrete Probability Distributions

**Objectives**

- Identify situations to be modeled with discrete probabilities
- Use bernoulli, binomial, geometric, hypergeometric, and poisson distributions
- Use `scipy` distributions to explore and solve probability problems
- Differentiate between `pdf` and `cdf` of distributions
