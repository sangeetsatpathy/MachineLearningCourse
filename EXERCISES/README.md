# Exercise Directory

#### Pandas
Introduction to the Pandas library. Learned about DataFrames, Series, data filtering, dropping data, and SAC.

#### Intro-EDA
Learned how to do data analysis on dataframes. Includes describing measures of center, measures of spread, other basic descriptive statistics, and visualizing data (box plots and correlation maps).

#### Data-Visualization
Learned different types of data visualizations: line graphs, scatter plots, bar graphs, histograms, and heat maps.

#### intro-to-statistics
Exploring different ways to analyze data: including the mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range, covariance and correlation.

#### Central-Limit-Theorem
Learning to construct a confidence interval to make statistical inferences given data (using the Central Limit Theorem)

#### hypothesis-testing-main
Defined the null and alternative hypotheses. Performed a two-sample t-test. Defined the t-statistics and p-value. Carried out the results of t-tests on OLS regression slopes.

#### discrete-probability-distributions
MModeled situations with discrete probabilities. Used bernoulli, binomial, geometric, and poisson distributions. Worked with `pdf` and `cdf` distributions

#### intro-linear-regression
Introducton to linear regression. Carried out simple and multiple linear regressions. Calculated mean squared error and other error metrics. Interpretted the coefficients of a linear regression model; and generatde predictions from an sklearn linear regression model.

#### polynomial-regression
Learnt about and used polynomial regression to fit more complex data.

#### Intro-Linear-Regularization
Introduction to regularization. Used and compared L1 and L2 regression to reduce variance in Linear and Polynomial Regression.

#### logistic-regression-main
Learnt to use logistic regression for classification problems. Evaluated logistic regression coefficients and interpretted their meaning.

#### classification-metrics
Learnt about true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives; Created a confusion matrix. Calculated accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, balanced accuracy, and ROC AUC. Plotted ROC curve

#### Cross-Validation
Learned train/test split and cross-validation. Compared these validation techniques. All exercises were done with Linear Regression.

#### Optimization
Programmed gradient descent technique from scratch, learnt how it minimizes loss functions.

#### GridSearch-and-Pipelines
Became familiar with using the GridSearchCV and Pipeline modules from sklearn. Utilized the GridSearchCV Library to find the most optimal hyperparameters. Used Pipelines to reduce redundancy and increase efficiency in code.

#### NLP
Learnt the Bag Of Words representation of Text. Used `scikitlearn` to Vectorize text, using both `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer`. Made classification models using the vectorized values.

#### intro-webscraping
Used the requests library to return the HTML content of a website. Used Beautiful Soup to parse HTML and extract useful data.
